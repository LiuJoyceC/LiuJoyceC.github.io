## Hey, Everyone!

I'm a full-stack software engineer who gets stoked about writing algorithms for challenging puzzles and exploring innovative new technology everyday. With a double degree in mathematics and cognitive sciences from Rice University, I've been a math geek with a creative flair my whole life. I have a passion for learning languages (both computer and human ones) and am fluent in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. I love dog-watching, singing at the top of my lungs when no one is around, wine tasting, balloon-animal twisting, and kicking your butt at a game of foosball. I grew up near Portland, but have lived in Houston, NYC, the Bay Area, Taipei, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Lima, and I now happily call Seattle my home :)
