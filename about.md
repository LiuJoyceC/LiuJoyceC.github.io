## Hey, Everyone!

I'm a former actuary learning to become a software engineer through [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/). With a double degree in mathematics and cognitive sciences from Rice University, I've been a math geek with a creative flair my whole life, and I'm stoked to now be writing awesome algorithms and exploring innovative new technology everyday. I've worked on various projects in Javascript and Python, and used to be a teaching assistant for a college course in MatLab. I have a passion for learning languages (both computer and human ones) and am fluent in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. I love dog-watching, singing at the top of my lungs when no one is around, wine tasting, and bouldering. I grew up near Portland, OR, but have spent some time living in Houston, NYC, Taipei, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Lima, and I now happily call Seattle my home :)

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/LiuJoyceC) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/LiuJoyceC).

Thanks for reading!
