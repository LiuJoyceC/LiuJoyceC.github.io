## Hey, Everyone!

I'm a former actuary learning to become a software developer through [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/). With a double degree in mathematics and cognitive sciences from Rice University, I've been a math geek with a creative flair my whole life, and I'm stoked to now be writing awesome algorithms and exploring innovative new technology everyday. I've had 3 years of professional experience with SAS and PROC SQL, have worked on various projects in Javascript and Python, and used to be a teaching assistant for a college course in MatLab. I have a passion for learning languages (both computer and human ones) and am fluent in English, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. I love dog-watching, singing at the top of my lungs when no one is around, wine tasting, and bouldering. I grew up near Portland, but have spent some time living in Houston, NYC, the Bay Area, Taipei, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Lima, and I now happily call Seattle my home :)

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/LiuJoyceC) and [CodePen](http://codepen.io/LiuJoyceC).

Thanks for reading!
