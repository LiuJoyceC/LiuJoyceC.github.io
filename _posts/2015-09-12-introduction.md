title: My First Weeks at Hack Reactor Remote Beta

Hey everyone! I recently decided to quit my job as an actuary and dive into a career in software development. This decision was mainly driven by my desire to work in a more exciting and innovative industry, and to finally put my love for writing algorithms to use. Although at first I was a little scared about throwing away years of working my way up as an actuary and now starting over completely in a new career, I haven't regretted my decision for a single minute. I'm now through my 4th week at Hack Reactor Remote Beta, and the journey has been amazing so far.

### Hack Reactor

[Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com) is a 3-month intensive coding bootcamp that aims to launch you at full speed into a career as a developer. The advent of coding bootcamps has made this career change possible for me. Given that I was already hesitant about starting my career over, going back to school for 4 years was not an option for me. And I specifically chose Hack Reactor because the vast majority of coding bootcamps out there just simply can't compete with HR's stellar reputation and ability to deliver results. If I'm going to make such a huge life change, I'm not placing bets with anything but the very best. One aspect that's very important to me (that sets HR apart from several other bootcamps I looked into) is that HR is not designed for people with no prior coding experience. When the program is only 3 months long, it's crucial to use all of that time learning new things and constantly pushing limits, so there's no time to waste on learning basic programming concepts if it's not all new to you. In fact, I think about half of the students in my cohort either hold computer science degrees or have prior professional experience as developers or hardware engineers. And none of the students were new to programming before getting accepted. The admissions process requires you to fill out a form using Javascript and then pass a technical interview.

### My Experience So Far

So I lied when I said the program is only 3 months long. Our first several required assignments were due before Day 1 of the program, so we technically had an extra month. I won't give specific details because I think I'm bound to secrecy about their curriculum, but we each had to create a dynamic website and rewrite Javascript libraries from scratch, among a few other assignments. Before Day 1. Or you don't get in. Sheesh, Hack Reactor is not kidding around!

I've now just wrapped up my 4th week of classes here. And it is intense. We have classes 6 days a week, from 9am to 8pm, and if you include the extra time you spend on homework, it's about 80-90 hours a week. Every 2 days, you get a new assignment (called a sprint) that you complete with a new assigned partner, and this goes on for the first 5 weeks. Then starting week 6 through the end of the program, you get longer-term group and individual projects to complete.

I've been impressed with the large variety of libraries, frameworks, and modules we've had to use on our assignments, both client-side and server-side. In addition to plain vanilla Javascript and the commonly used jQuery and Underscore libraries, we get to use D3, Backbone, Angular, Node (including a bunch of Node modules), and a lot more. So far, the sprints that I have found the most challenging are the ones where we write our own servers and debug in Node, since I knew nothing about web servers and http requests before coming into this program. However, this is exactly what I signed up for. While the algorithm sprints have been fun, I came here to learn things I don't already know how to do. I'm picking up on it quickly and I think writing asynchonous code is really cool, so I'm definitely getting a lot of value out of the server sprints.

D3 was pretty fun too, and I got to write a cute Mario-Kart-themed Collider game using that library during the second week. [Check it out here!](http://codepen.io/LiuJoyceC/full/XmrLdQ/) Drag the players around with your mouse to avoid getting hit by the flying Koopa shells.

The most difficult part of this whole experience: missing out on a social life. So many birthdays, housewarmings, and going-away parties where I couldn't be there for some of my closest friends. I even get paranoid sometimes and wonder if my friends will eventually forget I exist. My weekends only consist of Sunday, so I try to go out with friends on Saturday night if I manage to finish my assignments before the end of the night. In the first two weeks, I thought the perfect way to unwind after such a long week was to get drunk with friends. However, I quickly realized that when you only have a one-day weekend, it is not worth it to spend that entire day hungover and not able to truly relax. Then Monday just comes too quickly and you feel like you got no break at all. So the secret to not burning out is to go have fun with friends but NOT get too drunk. Then I can enjoy a wonderful Sunday and feel slightly more refreshed on Monday.

Despite being sleep-deprived and having very little of a social life for 3 months, I'm so stoked about how much I'm learning and can't wait to unleash these mad skills in the real world in just a few months!
