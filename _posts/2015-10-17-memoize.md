title: Memoization

Often times, we must call a resource-intensive function multiple times, even though the output it produces is the same each time. The repetition of operations that will eventually result in the same output can be rather wasteful, and in some cases, can be easily resolved using memoization.

According to Wikipedia: "In computing, memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again."

### Using Memoization to the Find the nth Fibonacchi Number

For example, let's take a look at a classic recursion algorithm:

function nthFibonacci(n) {
if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
return n;
} else {
return nthFibonacci(n - 1) + nthFibonacci(n - 2);
}
}

In order to solve nthFibonacci(5), we have solve nthFibonacci(4) and nthFibonacci(3) and return their sum.
